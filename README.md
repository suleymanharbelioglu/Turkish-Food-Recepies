# Turkish Food Recepies App
  It is a simple application made with the Flutter SDK that includes the ingredients and recipes needed to make 10 popular dishes from Turkish cuisine.

- The application consists of two pages: a "Food List" and a "Food Recipe" Page.
- The application starts with the "Food List" Page. This page contains the 10 most popular Turkish Foods.
From the list, users can click on the food they select to access the related recipe.
- At the top of the 'Recipe' Page, there is a large image of the dish. As users scroll down, they will
reach the ingredients and recipe sections. Thanks to the scrolling effect, the photo reduces in size.
